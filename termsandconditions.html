                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be
                            deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver
                            of any other term or condition, and any failure of Company to assert a
                            right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right
                            or provision.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent
                            jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such
                            provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that
                            the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and effect.
